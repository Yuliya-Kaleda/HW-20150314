# HW-20150314
First text game

Comments about the game:

//Ideally, I would love to put a list of countries in a separate file "Countries.txt" and use it through BufferedReader. 
//But I did not have enough time to figure out how to connect BufferedReader and my code. 

//Things that could be improved about my game:
* to use some methods to make the code less complex looking;
* to fix userInput to make it case and whitespace insensative

I would appreciate any feedback and advice on polishing the code! Thank you!
